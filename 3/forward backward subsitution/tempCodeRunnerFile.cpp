// // Write a C++ program to solve equation Ax = b for x. Here A is n×n matrix and b is a n×1 vector.

// Read A and b from a file matrix.dat. This file has 2n+1 lines. First line has only one positive integer ie value of n.
// Next n rows have rows of matrix A, entries in a row are separated by comma.
// Next n rows have one integer each corresponding to element of b.

// Your program should check if A is lower triangular or upper triangular and then solve for x using forward / backward substitution.
// Otherwise program should generate an exception.
